# RICK
idk what to name it


## What he is
Rick is a password manager. He keeps all of you passwords hidden in a special vault that nobody can touch but you. You can tell him **all** of your secrets (as long as they are 4 digit pins). 

## Why he is
This was my final project for my computer science class. My teacher gave me permission to go all out and this is the only thing I was able to come up with. Sad

## How he is
He always feels like garbage because he is. He also has a tiny Steve Jobs inside, so that makes him feel worse.

## Why I love him still
Rick has a couple of very, *very* dark black boxes inside of him. He was never built to work, just be impossible to understand. For that, he has a terrible social life with me as his only friend. Be nice to him.

### What do you mean by black box?
A black box is the idea of having something do something, but nobody has any idea of how it happens, how it works, or exactly what it does. It's as if all the moving parts are inside of some dark box you can't see into.

### Why it's hard to understand
I created a project inspired by a project inspired by a paper inspired by an idea. The idea is anything can be computed by moving memory around. That's all those boxes do (sort of). Other than being terribly hilarious, that has been a serious project to explore obfuscation ideas to show how we need stronger people in the reverse engineering field (or just give them some money and love).

### What is this other project?
I'm calling it [Mitsy](https://repl.it/@haltosan/mitsy) (phonetically, more like mitc). It stands for Mov Is Turing Complete (an x86 assembly instruction and the name of the paper). I'm not the first to do something like this (see [movfuscator](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator)), but it was a great learning experience (and devilishly fun to see work).



Enjoy ;)
